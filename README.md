# Claude and Langfuse Spaghetti

## Folder Contents
- data - This folder contains data from https://github.com/FranxYao/chain-of-thought-hub
- src - This contains two folders, Notebooks and Scripts. 

You'll find the playground where i've started playing around with the Bedrock implementation of Claude 3 Opus/Sonnet. Across the notebooks and scripts, you'll find simple implementations of a BedrockRuntime client
that will allow you to invoke the Claude 3 models.




*Note*
src/notebooks/bedrock.ipynb is the base implementation that all other implementations follow.
src/notebooks/llama_anthropic.ipynb is testing of the Llama_index implementation of the Anthropic client for Claude 3.
src/notebooks/evals.ipynb is running evaluations with the Anthropic client.



If you have questions feel free to reach out.
